        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <p>Since childhood I have been passionate about software development, 
          in middle school I was  interested on learning how a computers works, 
          so I decided to enroll in an introduction to web development course, 
          that was a very satisfying experience and made me decide for more knowledge 
          in the field, hence in high school I enter to a software development program 
          where I learned many things, such as object-oriented programming, mobile app 
          development and database management.</p>
        <p>For me, applying the knowledge to real life problems is the best way to 
          learn about something, hence why I started to make my first personal projects 
          on high school. I have worked in solutions for my classes, for example, 
          implementing C++ functions to evaluate physics functions.</p>
        <p>The first project that I worked in, was a webpage for a local business, I worked on 
          the backend of the contact form and newsletter. Then I worked in a project of administration 
          of a mechanical workshop, there I developed it with databases and PHP. Also I worked on 
          a logistic platform for shipments in an industrial warehouse, that was one of my most 
          challenging project because I have to learn the logistic process of shipments and implement 
          that in the platform as well as create the database relations and finally I learn about 
          servers in order to implement the software in cloud.</p>
        <p>My strongest programming language is C++, since all my university courses have been taught 
          in that language, I am learning data structures and I find myself more comfortable using C++ 
          than other languages, also I have participated in competitive programming contest and I use C++ too.</p>
