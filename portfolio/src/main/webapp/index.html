        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <p>Since childhood I have been passionate about software development, 
          in middle school I was  interested on learning how a computers works, 
          so I decided to enroll in an introduction to web development course, 
          that was a very satisfying experience and made me decide for more knowledge 
          in the field, hence in high school I enter to a software development program 
          where I learned many things, such as object-oriented programming, mobile app 
          development and database management.</p>
        <p>For me, applying the knowledge to real life problems is the best way to 
          learn about something, hence why I started to make my first personal projects 
          on high school. I have worked in solutions for my classes, for example, 
          implementing C++ functions to evaluate physics functions.</p>
        <p>The first project that I worked in, was a webpage for a local business, I worked on 
          the backend of the contact form and newsletter. Then I worked in a project of administration 
          of a mechanical workshop, there I developed it with databases and PHP. Also I worked on 
          a logistic platform for shipments in an industrial warehouse, that was one of my most 
          challenging project because I have to learn the logistic process of shipments and implement 
          that in the platform as well as create the database relations and finally I learn about 
          servers in order to implement the software in cloud.</p>
        <p>My strongest programming language is C++, since all my university courses have been taught 
          in that language, I am learning data structures and I find myself more comfortable using C++ 
          than other languages, also I have participated in competitive programming contest and I use C++ too.</p>

          <h1>Image Gallery</h1>
          <p>Definitely I really like to photograph views that are amazing for me, one great example 
              of those are the views of cities that I take from high places, for me, is very interesting 
              to see nature and streets for another point of view. When I am at a new place, no taking 
              pictures is not an option, I really like to take photos and then share them with my 
              friends and family.</p>
          <p>Architecture, Buildings, Skyscrapers are one of my favorites things to see and photograph, 
              they really give me satisfaction and peacefulness. I am not an expert in Art and maybe 
              that why I like to take pictures of it, it is nice to see pictures of art that I have seen 
              in the past and I did not understand, and then realize the amazing piece that I was looking at.</p>
          <p>Last but not least I like to take selfies and pictures with family and friends that are important 
              to me. I think that keeping memories in photograph an then look for them is very fun and is a 
              nice way to keep memories alive.</p>

          <ul>
              <li>Play the guitar
                  <p>One of my hobbies is playing guitar. I moved from my native city to Monterrey in 2019, since 
                      that, I havenâ€™t had the time that I had before to play, that is why not so much people know 
                      that I play, but definitely it is one of the thing I enjoy the most.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Teaching
                  <p>When I learn something new, I know that teaching it, is the most important part of learning, 
                      it may sound a little confusing but definitely if you want to be an expert at something, 
                      teaching it is the best way to achieve that.</p>
